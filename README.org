#+TITLE: DiME: Distribution from Mean using neural network

DiMe is a python software package to compute the distribution in gene expression from mean dose-response curves. DiMe was
developed to compute the gene expression distribution for the synthetic genetic sensors developed by NIST's Genetic Sensor Foundry (https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.202010179). The neural network model was trained using the flow cytometry data for 100 genetic sensors and was then used to predict the gene expression distribution of the other sensors in the library (approx. 50,000).

* System Requirements

** Hardware requirements
   ~DiMe~ was primarily developed and used on an Apple M1 MacBook Pro with 16 GB RAM. Other computers should be also adequate.

** Software requirements
   DiMe is supported for macOS, Monterey (12.4), and has not been tested for other systems yet.

** Python Dependencies
   ~DiMe~ needs the following libraries:
   - ~TensorFlow~
   - ~pandas~
   - ~numpy~
   - ~scipy~
