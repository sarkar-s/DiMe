#+TITLE: DiME: Distribution from Mean using neural network

DiMe is a python software package to compute the distribution in gene expression from mean dose-response curves. DiMe was
developed to compute the gene expression distribution for the synthetic genetic sensors developed by NIST's Genetic Sensor Foundry (https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.202010179). The cytometry and the mean dose-response data used to train DiMe and then predict the gene expression distribution are from the above paper.

* System Requirements

** Hardware requirements
   ~DiMe~ was primarily developed and used on an Apple MacMini with 16 GB RAM. Other computers should be also adequate.

** Software requirements
   DiMe is supported for macOS, Monterey (12.4), and has not been tested for other systems yet.

** Python Dependencies
   ~DiMe~ needs the following libraries:
   - ~TensorFlow~
   - ~pandas~
   - ~numpy~
   - ~scipy~
